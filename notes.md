# Notes

## Todos
- Better wave spawn logic
- Buildable towers
- Menu?
- Score/Money/Point system
    - Upgradeable Towers
    - Upgradeable/purchaseable items/skills? No classes?
        - Start game with no shot ability, buy first ability/weapon. How many items/abilities? 
- Potential classes:
    - Clicker/UI Input Delay class for handling "delay repeating keystroke", "pause for .5 seconds on first press, then repeat keystroke every .1 seconds thereafter", etc
    - Items class as a parent of Purchaseable/PlayerAbility? Are purchaseables _all_ items?
    - Hotbars class
    - Inventory class if more than just hotbar? Consumables? Throwables?

## Thoughts
- How many Scenes? Should tower building be separate scene?

## Ideas
- Three basic towers:
    - Single shot, weak, fast (Tower1)
    - Single shot, strong, pierce, medium
    - Single shot, medium, aoe, slow, DoT
- Three classes:
    - Warrior - Melee/Med/Cleave
    - Ranger - Range/Slow/Pierce
    - Wizard - Range/Fast/Single Target
